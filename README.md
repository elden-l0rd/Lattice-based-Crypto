### Implementation of Coppersmith Attack on RSA

This implementation demonstrates its application in factoring RSA moduli when there is a partial key exposure. It checks the Coppersmith condition, constructs a lattice matrix, and applies the LLL algorithm to find potential roots of a polynomial. Then, filter and validate these roots to discover potential factors of the RSA modulus.

Nonetheless, RSA remains secure when implemented with strong key lengths and proper random prime numbers.
